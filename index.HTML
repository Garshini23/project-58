        <p> Reading could help you live longer
            People who read books live for around two years longer than those who don’t, irrespective of gender, wealth, education or health, according to a Yale University study. While a similar association was found among readers of newspapers, it was weaker.

            “Book reading contributed to a survival advantage that was significantly greater than that observed for reading newspapers or magazines,” the authors of the study wrote. “Compared to non-book readers, book readers had a 23-month survival advantage,” they noted.

            Deep reading promotes empathy and emotional intelligence - cognitive processes that can lead to greater chance of survival, the report explained.You may absorb more from a physical book
            Some studies suggest students take in more information from paper than from screens, underlining the case for picking up an actual book rather than an e-reader. One study in Norway showed students who read texts in print scored better on reading comprehension tests than students who read digitally.

            A review of educational research published by SAGE Journals showed readers may not comprehend complex or lengthy material as well when they view it digitally.</p>
